  1) This code uses the MIMETEXT library and smtplib to create the bulk notification structure. 

  2) Through the inclusion of datetime, schedule and time libraries, we will be able to send a scheduled message to desired personel.]
  
  3) I have created a systematic way through def functions to signify the conclusive role of the certain part of the code.
  
  4) I have Used smtp server as a way to connect bulk accounts to a single notification system so that the messages can be sent in a faster way.
  
  5) The code doesn't showcase a very complex code program but almost a sample of the same.
  
  6) The repository conatins both a basic structured code of the program and a sample progam showcasing the requirements defined in the prompt.
